# This example contains a cycle if you have to resolve modules as a whole
# It should be possible to resolve this without getting stuck in a loop
# First T1 and T2 are resolved using `use C`, but without using 
# `B::T1` or `A::T2`
# Then T3 and T4 are resolved using the already resolved T1 and T2
module C
  struct Foo
    struct Bar

  use C
  type T2 = Foo
  type T4 = Bar

module B
  use A::T2
  use C
  type T1 = Foo
